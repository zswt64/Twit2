#SoCoolFunction.js

This bot retweets the latest tweet using the "#music" hashtag. It attempts to retweet once per hour. This bot also comments "This is so cool" in the cooresponding post.



#RhymeBot.js

This bot uses the Wordnik API to create a list of rhyming words, and Tweets the rhymes in addition to the #music post. Our bot tweets out rhymes to a word of our choice—an argument that is passed in by the user—not one passed in by Twitter itself.



#SpotifyBot.js

This bot contains a function that posts a 30 second song preview link from Spotify's API. The function gives out songs related to a particular word and selects the top song to post with the preview link.



#Config.js

This file contains the Twitter Developer Keys which connects our TwitterBot account to the code we've written.
